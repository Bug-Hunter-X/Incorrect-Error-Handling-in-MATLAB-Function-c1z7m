# Incorrect Error Handling in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB: incorrect error handling.  The function `myFunction` is designed to return 0 when the input is negative, but it incorrectly returns -1. This issue can lead to unexpected results and potentially crash the program.

The `bug.m` file contains the faulty function, and `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected version.
